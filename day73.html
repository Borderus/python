      Ben's Favourite Python Projects

    <h3>
      Calculator
    </h3>

    </a>
    <p>
      As part of the toe-dip into OOP, we built a calculator! This project was the first encounter with Lambda functions, though as the title at the top belies, there are further plans for this one.

    <h3>
      Diary
    </h3>

    </a>
    <p>
      A super-secret diary! Complete with a hashed and salted password to keep out intruders, this project maintained the contents between sessions in ReplitDB.

    <h3>
      Hangman
    </h3>

    <p>
      A classic! The children's game, brought to life on your screen. Actually easier than anticipated, once we'd sourced the ASCII art.

    <h3>

    </h3>

      The highest rated episode of the Simpsons on IMDB is Marge vs. The Monorail, an utter classic. And now, you can relive it in all its glory as a Choose Your Own Adventure game!
